Research question



coding:

single run:
- Initial population
	So Initial population = N * Neural networks
- Evaluation
- Crossover, which one, why and when ? 
- mutation, which one, why and when ? 
- Evaluation of new generation, which ones to keep, which ones deleted.
- End best evaluation

The single run should be done until good fitness level and should be done for all levels so 8 times  and 10 times per level and for both EA ( around 10 I thought, and then take mean std, etc) 
- Evaluate which NN to use on different levels  ( at least 3, and use only on each other). 

Plots of results:
- Compare your algorithms by enemy, making a line-plot across the 	generations, with the average/std (for the mean and the maximum) of 	the fitness. Note that you need to calculate the average (over the 	10 runs) of the mean and maximum (over the population in each 	generation). Do one plot by enemy, thus, separately
- Box plot : In summary, it is a total of 3 pairs of box-plots (so 6 boxes), 	being one pair per enemy. Additionally, do a statistical test to 	verify if the differences in the average of these means are 	significant between the groups of best solutions, when comparing two 	algorithms of an enemy
